# NEO Legacy vs NEO 3 (N3)

If you are like me who haven't followed much closely about NEO 3 (N3) but you are quite familiar with NEO (Legacy), You might find yourself trying to find more information about N3 and wanting to see what's the difference, what has changed. I have gone through that process and summarized what I find from both developer perspective and consumer(Crypto Investor) perspective. Start with the basic questions such as does the number of NEO or GAS change?, Is NEO divisible now in N3?, etc. I hope this post helps you get a better understanding of what N3 offers and answer some of the questions you might have.
